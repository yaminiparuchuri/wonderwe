Founded in 1985, Literacy Kansas City has grown to become the premiere area agency focused solely on adult literacy instruction through evidence-based adult literacy programming. Literacy Kansas City has touched thousands of adults reading at or below the basic level of literacy- meaning approximately fifth grade- throughout the Kansas City metro.  In addition to providing one to one and small group tutoring to students, Literacy Kansas City has broadened the delivery of our literacy instruction to include innovative classroom-based programs coupled with one-to-one tutoring, culminating in the GEARS (Guided Educational Access to Reading Skills) program in partnership with Penn Valley Community College. The success of this program led to the development of a new project: the Family Literacy Project. For the first time, Literacy Kansas City offers programming with a multi-generational approach to the inter-generational problem of illiteracy that includes classroom, tutoring and family and digital literacy components.In January 2015, Literacy Kansas City will launch the Impact Initiative. This research-driven, community-based literacy effort maximizes organizational efficiency and programmatic effectiveness through strategic barrier elimination, and meets students where they are, both academically and geographically. Through partnerships with the Kansas City Public Library, Mid-Continent Public Library, Connecting for Good, Kansas City Public Schools, Turn the Page KC, Upper Room, LINC, and KC Parks and Recreation, we will establish satellite sites throughout the metro. In addition to our home offices, these sites will be convenient locations for students to access comprehensive, computer-based literacy education that includes balanced literacy instruction, digital literacy, job readiness, ELL, and more.",
