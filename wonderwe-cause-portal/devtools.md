# Development Tools

######  MySql WorkBench

We use couple of packages in Atom, Open [Atom] editor and Go to    
`Atom -> Preferences -> Packages `  
search the following packages and install

###### a. Atom-beautify
- Package is used to format the code. 
- Shotcut --   `Ctl+Alt+b`   

###### b. Emmet
- Here's how it works if you don't: Just type `.container and hit Ctl+e` to create     a div-element with the class container.

- eg-1:  By typing `div.container`, you're telling Emmet to create this:
``` sh
<div class="container">
</div>
```

- By typing `ul#emmet-pros>li.emmet-pro*3`, youre telling Emmet to create this:
``` sh
<ul id="emmet-pros">
<li class="emmet-pro"></li>
<li class="emmet-pro"></li>
<li class="emmet-pro"></li>
</ul>
``` 
- Then you can jump from one edit point to the next to quickly fill in the content. 
``` sh 
Shortcut --  Ctl+e 
```

##### Chrome plugins 
###### 1. PostMan 

- Postman is a Web REST client that allows you to enter and monitor HTTP requests and responses.
- Postman helps you be extremely efficient while working with APIs.
- With Postman, you can construct requests quickly, save them for later use and analyze the responses sent by the API. Postman can dramatically cut down the time required to test and develop APIs. Postman adapts itself for individual developers, small teams or big organizations equally well.
